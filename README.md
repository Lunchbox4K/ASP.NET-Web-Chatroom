ASP.NET MVC Chat Room 

	[Example Page](http://mpwchat.azurewebsites.net/Home/chat)

	> This is a simple chat room I made for my ASP.NET class. It uses a SignalR hub as the server,
		and Razor along with JavaScript for the client view.
		
	> IDE: Visual Studio Ultimate 2013
	
	> The three files that make up the chat room are:
	
		[ChatHub.cs](blob/master/Web ChatRoom/WebChatRoom/Hubs/ChatHub.cs)
		[mpw-chat.js](blob/master/Web ChatRoom/WebChatRoom/Scripts/mpw-chat.js)
		[Chat.cshtml](blob/master/Web ChatRoom/WebChatRoom/Views/Home/Chat.cshtml)
